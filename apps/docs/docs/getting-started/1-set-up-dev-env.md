# Step 1 - Set Up Dev Env

## Getting Started

Create your project from our template. We'll create one called `my-integrations` and refer to it as such throughout this tutorial, but feel free to use whatever name you like.

```shell
npx @bigidea/cli create my-integrations
```

Change to the directory and log in to the app using the command line.
```shell
cd my-integrations
npm run login
```

Start the dev server.
```shell
npm run dev
```
