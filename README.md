# Big Idea Integration

This is a prototype of a new approach to building integrations using an old and reliable technique: write some code!

## Getting Started

Create your project for our template.

```shell
npx @bigidea/cli create my-integrations
```

Change to the directory and log in to the app using the command line.
```shell
cd my-integrations
npm run login
```

Start the dev server.
```shell
npm run dev
```

This will direct your browser to your [dashboard](https://integration.bigidea.io/prototype), where you can see the sample integrations.

## Documentation

You can find the latest documentation on our [website](https://docs.bigidea.io).
